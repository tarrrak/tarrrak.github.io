Main aim
========

TL;DR: Wavelets & frequencies\
In this short essay I present the idea of Continuous Wavelet Transform
(CWT) and Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST). I concentrate on advantages
(and disadvantages) of the method, intuition and Synchrosqueezing
Transform (SST), which is a novel way to estimate frequencies. It is
always good to illustrate pros and cons, so I present analysis of
exemplary functions and real data.\
This work is based on two articles: intro to SST by famous Daubechies
@daub and approach to estimate respiratory rate using SST @ppg.

Wavelets
========

Definitions & Intuition
-----------------------

Imagine time series \\( f(t) \\) $f(t)$ in time $t$ and a function $\psi$, which

-   is normalized

-   has mean value equal to zero.

For physicist, it is better to take functions, which are, of course,
smooth and well-localized in space and in time domain. We call such
functions wavelets. Then, we calculate Continuous Wavelet Transform
(CWT):

$$W_f (a,b) = \int f(t) \overline{\psi\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right)} dt$$

where $a$ is a scale and $b$ is a shift. The function $\psi$ and
parameters $a$ and $b$ forms a family of functions, which are not
orthogonal. Since that, we cannot decompose original signal into an
eigenbasis from function $\psi$. Hovewer, $W_f(a,b)$ gives us insight
into scaling properties of the signal. Although the parameter $a$ has
units of time, it is neither time nor frequency. This leads to variety
of misconceptions. In fact, the parameter $a$ is only a scaling factor,
which widens the base function $\psi$ and as a result changes the
overlap with the signal.

Morlet Wavelet
--------------

Pywavelet and Mathematica use real Morlet wavelet. It is localized in
frequencies around zero. It is more common to use complex version of
Morlet wavelet, which is well-localized in space and in time domain. It
is given by the following formula , up to normalization factor:

$$\psi(t) \propto e^{-\frac{1}{2}t^2} (e^{i \sigma t} - e^{-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2})$$

Real and imaginary parts creates spiral in 3D space, but we plot below
Morlet wavelet in 2D:

Synchrosqueezing Transform
==========================

Definitions
-----------

We see that CWT gives nice plots (heatmaps), but we do not extract any
useful information. Let construct instantaneous frequency [^1]

$$\omega_f(a,b) = -i \frac{\partial_b W_f(a,b)}{W_f(a,b)}.$$

For sine function and a wavelet, which has only positive Fourier
components, instantaneous frequency is just the frequency of sine and
does not depend on parameter $a$ and used wavelet if it has only
positive frequency components [^2]. But it is still a function of $a$
and $b$ [^3]. Hence, at given shift $b$ we sum up CWTs with scaling if
instantaneous frequency is proper [^4]. As a result, we get
time-frequency dependence

$$T_f(\omega, b) = \frac{1}{\Delta \omega} \sum_{a:|\omega_f(a,b) - \omega| \approx 0} (W_f(a,b) a^{-3/2} \Delta a),$$

where $T$ is the main result, which extracts information about frequency
from CWT. So we sum up only CWTs for proper instantaneous frequencies
with weighting factors. It seems to be easy, but there are some
numerical problems…

Numerical Problems
------------------

There are few indirect calculations to obtain $T_f(\omega,b)$. Computing
of CWT is quite obvious and well-known. It is just discretized integral.
We need to chose the range of scales. The same situation takes place
when we calculate $\partial_b W_f(a,b)$. It is just another discretized
integral, but using derivative of wavelet

$$\partial_b W_f (a,b) = \int f(t) \partial_b \overline{\psi\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right)} dt$$

As mentioned before, there are problems with boundaries, but it is just
the effect of finite signal size [^5], so we should avoid very small
scale $a$.\
Computing instantaneous frequencies requires division. Vanishing
denominators are problematic, but we can just ommit such cases due to
insignificance of such CWT’s in computing $T$. The last step, summation
to obtain $T$, takes a long time because of plenty of smaller
calculations.\
My code written in Python uses only dense matrices. We should use sparse
matrices instead and neglect unnecessary terms. We should: consider fast
decaying behaviour of wavelets (limit support), remove instantaneous
frequencies with large imaginary part and neglect negligible CWTs. I
roll vector of discretized wavelet to mimic shift, so I impose periodic
boundary conditions. It is easy to implement and as bad as any other
method near boundaries of signal. Another important stuff is the choice
of scales, shifts and frequencies.

Examples & Real Data
--------------------

Here I present plots of functions, their CWTs and SSTs. We can see that
main beahaviour is recovered. Problems with boundaries are also visible
and significantly influence sides of SST diagrams. I put the same time
span for simplicity and standarization. If we divide frequency by
$2\pi$, we get number of periods in this time domain.\
Frequencies of simply functions are recovered correctly, as shown in
[fig:sina] and [fig:sinb]. We can also observe ’noisy’ frequencies,
which is strange.\
Functions like $sin^n(t)$ when $n$ is even number tend to train of Dirac
deltas. Scaling property of such functions leads to multiplicities of
basic frequency on SST diagrams.\
It is useful to extract information about heart rate and respiratory
rate from biomedical signals. My PhotoPlethysmoGraph, as shown in
[fig:ppg] has really good quality, so we observe two dominating
frequencies. Their ratio is correct.\
The electrocardiogram (part in [fig:ecg]) is provided from scipy.misc .
Correct frequency for HR is ca. 55. Blurry part of CWT influence
significantly SST diagram. Higher harmonics are still present, as in
case of Dirac deltas’ train.\
The behaviour of financial data is always a mystery. I used SST on some
stock prizes and results are shown in [fig:gld] and [fig:fb].

[^1]: It is angular frequency, as $\omega$ in $\sin{(\omega t)}$

[^2]: Complex Morlet wavelet is localized around arbitrary frequency and
    it has, unfortunately, negative frequency components. Then, for sine
    function we get correct frequency multiplied by a factor, which
    usually is closed to 1.

[^3]: Instantaneous frequencies can be complex numbers!

[^4]: It is kind of weighting instantaneous frequencies.

[^5]: Too wide wavelet does not give satisfying results near boundaries,
    which are unfortunately cutoffs.
